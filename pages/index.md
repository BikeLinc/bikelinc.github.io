## About Me

I am a senior **BSCE student** at FLC, passionate about building and designing new technologies to solve complex problems. 

I have experience in various programming languages, including:
- Python, C++, C#, C  
- AVR Assembly, x86_64 Assembly  
- MATLAB, Verilog  

Additionally, I am proficient in several electronic design automation (EDA) tools, such as **Autodesk Eagle**, **LT Spice**, and **Electric VLSI**. 

I also have experience working with microcontrollers for environmental air-quality applications. On top of that, I have hands-on expertise in nano-fabrication and I am currently overseeing photolithography processes for our senior project, where we aim to build functional **PMOS MOSFETs**.

## Featured Projects

### Development of a Low-Cost CO₂ Flux Measurement System  
I worked with **Dr. Joanna Casey** on developing a low-cost CO₂ flux measurement system for post-wildfire environments. The system relies on a CO₂ sensor and a microcontroller to measure flux in real time. It is designed to be both affordable and easy to deploy in the field.

### Design and Fabrication of a PMOS MOSFET  
I am currently leading the photolithography process to design and fabricate a **PMOS MOSFET** using nano-fabrication techniques. Our team uses a mask aligner to pattern the MOSFET on a silicon wafer in the **FLC Nanofabrication Lab**.

Feel free to explore more details on each of these projects using the navigation above.
